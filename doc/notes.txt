TODO:

. DONE: Overwrite configuration pid_sample is now an integer (not a float)
. DONE: Test PID outputs with the SetSampleTime() and SetTunings() inverted: check w/ Serial.print

. Need to stabilize data from MPU and Compass before moving forward ... 
	. Test the card outside of the drone to check if the problem comes from the EM of the motors (same power line)

THEN:
. Try a P-D-I tuning (increase P until oscillations appear, then damping w/ D , then improve w/ I):
  =>  https://oscarliang.com/quadcopter-pid-explained-tuning/
. Implement TPA: throttle PID attenuation:
  => http://intofpv.com/t-what-is-tpa-in-cleanflight
. Re-test proportionnal on measurement ?? with correct order of SetSampleTime() / SetTunnings()

. MPU6050 Datasheet:
  . DONE: Check values standard deviation while motors are running
  . DONE: Attached the drone on a plane surface and push the motors up to 100% speed while monitoring with BT/minicom
  . DONE: => this is the noise for the PID inputs and then ...

. BMP180:
  . From BMP085 datasheet:
    "sampling rate can be increased up to 128 samples per second (standard mode). It is sufficient to measure the T°C only once per second
     and use this value for all pressure measurements during the same period"
    "All modes can be performed at higher speed, e.g up to 128 times per second for standard mode [...] This way the noise can be decreased further
     by software averaging."

  . Check calibration coefficients (Chinese):
