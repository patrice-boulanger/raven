TODO:

. Try a P-D-I tuning (increase P until oscillations appear, then damping w/ D , then improve w/ I):
  =>  https://oscarliang.com/quadcopter-pid-explained-tuning/
. Implement TPA: throttle PID attenuation:
  => http://intofpv.com/t-what-is-tpa-in-cleanflight

. HMC5883 Datasheet
  . Procedure for "SCALE FACTOR TEMPERATURE COMPENSATION" available
  . Compass is still not accurate:
    . Check pin w/ a magnet
    . Move to front side of the drone

. BMP180:
  . From BMP085 datasheet:
    "sampling rate can be increased up to 128 samples per second (standard mode). It is sufficient to measure the T°C only once per second
     and use this value for all pressure measurements during the same period"
    "All modes can be performed at higher speed, e.g up to 128 times per second for standard mode [...] This way the noise can be decreased further
     by software averaging."

  . Check calibration coefficients (Chinese):
    #if BMP085_USE_DATASHEET_VALS
      _bmp085_coeffs.ac1 = 408;
      _bmp085_coeffs.ac2 = -72;
      _bmp085_coeffs.ac3 = -14383;
      _bmp085_coeffs.ac4 = 32741;
      _bmp085_coeffs.ac5 = 32757;
      _bmp085_coeffs.ac6 = 23153;
      _bmp085_coeffs.b1  = 6190;
      _bmp085_coeffs.b2  = 4;
      _bmp085_coeffs.mb  = -32768;
      _bmp085_coeffs.mc  = -8711;
      _bmp085_coeffs.md  = 2868;
      _bmp085Mode        = 0;
    #else

  . During operation, the device is sensitive to light. The hole in the top lid shall not be exposed to direct light during operation.
