TODO:

NOT DONE . Measure voltage from BEC & SBUS (oscilloscope ?) before/after decoupling

. DONE: Install a decoupling capacitor on the PDB
. NOT DONE: Install a decoupling capacitor on the SBUS pin (?)
. DONE: Install a decoupling capacitor between Vcc & GND on the sensor board 
. Interesting information at http://rab.ict.pwr.wroc.pl/~mw/Files/AN1646.pdf

. Serial:
  . https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_uart.html
  . Serial1 & 2 support 8 byte transmit and receive FIFOs, which allow for higher speed baud rates, even when other libraries create interrupt latency.
  . DONE: Try to move from Serial3 to Serial1/2: swap PIN7 -> PIN(0/9) & PIN8 -> PIN(1/10) to see if it solves interference problem

. BMP180:
  . From BMP085 datasheet:
    "sampling rate can be increased up to 128 samples per second (standard mode). It is sufficient to measure the T°C only once per second
     and use this value for all pressure measurements during the same period"
    "All modes can be performed at higher speed, e.g up to 128 times per second for standard mode [...] This way the noise can be decreased further
     by software averaging."

  . Check calibration coefficients (Chinese):
    #if BMP085_USE_DATASHEET_VALS
      _bmp085_coeffs.ac1 = 408;
      _bmp085_coeffs.ac2 = -72;
      _bmp085_coeffs.ac3 = -14383;
      _bmp085_coeffs.ac4 = 32741;
      _bmp085_coeffs.ac5 = 32757;
      _bmp085_coeffs.ac6 = 23153;

  . DONE: Startup time before after power-up the device: 10ms
  . During operation, the device is sensitive to light. The hole in the top lid shall not be exposed to direct light during operation.
  . DONE: 100nF between Vdd and GND for pullup resistors!
  
. HMC5883 Datasheet
  . DONE: Measurement Period, from receiving command to data ready: 6 ms
  . DONE: Vdd is linked to GND via a 0.1µF capacitor for pullup resistors!
  . The Table below shows all selectable output rates in continuous measurement mode. All three channels shall be measured within a given output rate
  . With the data rate at the factory default of 15Hz updates, a 67 milli-second typical delay should be allowed by the I2C master before querying the HMC5883L data registers for new measurements. This is 33ms for 30Hz.
  . DONE: ( ... ) or monitor status register or DRDY hardware interrupt pin (OK)
  . Procedure for "SCALE FACTOR TEMPERATURE COMPENSATION" available

. MPU6050 Datasheet:
  . DONE: GYROSCOPE START-UP TIME: 30 ms
  . Interrupt Status can report interesting information: getIntFreefallStatus()/getIntMotionStatus()/getIntZeroMotionStatus()

. EEPROM:
  . Configuration struct: embeds all settings needed for raven
  . Functions: eeprom_load(struct *) & eeprom_save(struct *)
  . Checksum 

. Shell:
  . User command
  . get/set/show

. Pinout diagram embedded in the drone (?)
