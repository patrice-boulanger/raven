Wiring:
. Move PINs 9&10 to PINs 21&22: free the SPI bus
. Attach S-Port from XSR to PIN 8
. Add a GND bar near the teensy
. Attach Connect buzzer to PIN 6 (PWM)
. Attach 2/3 LEDs on PINs 3,4 & 5: RED = LEFT, GREEN = RIGHT, WHITE = BACK
. Board w/ MPU & HMC, if possible BMP: I2C wiring + resistor

Program:
. New structure attitude:
  . pitch, roll, yaw angular speeds (rads or deg /s ?)
  . x,y,z acceleration (in g or in m.s-2 ?)
  . pitch, roll angles (radians or degrees ?)
  . heading (rads or deg ?)
  . vertical speed (m.s-1)
  . previous value to calculate speeds
  
. Initialize MPU, HMC, BMP
. Calibrate the sensors

. Main loop:
  . Delta time dt in (µs or ms ?)
   
  . Read raw values from mpu
  . Read raw value from compass
  . Read raw value from barometer
  
  . Convert accel/gyro: https://www.i2cdevlib.com/forums/topic/4-understanding-raw-values-of-accelerometer-and-gyrometer/
    . Compute accelerations
  . Use the complementary filter to stabilize the values
  . Compensate roll/pitch to compute heading
  . Compute angular speeds (w/ dt) 
  . Computer vertical speed (w/ dt)
